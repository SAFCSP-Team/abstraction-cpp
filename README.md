**Problem**

Create  a `Vehicle` class using the abstraction concept.

**Implementation**

* Create a `Vehicle` abstract class. With `name` and `brand` attributes and `start()` as a virtual function.
* Create a class called `Car` that extends the `Vehicle` abstract class.
* Implement the `start()` method in the `car` class. To print the car's name.
* In the main method, Create an object from the `Car` class, and call the `start()` method.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

/* your code here */

int main() {
 
    return 0;
}
```
